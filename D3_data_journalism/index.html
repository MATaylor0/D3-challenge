          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2><hr>
          <h4>In Poverty (%)</h4>
          <p>Using Poverty rate as the independant variable shows a weak positive correlation between all three dependant variables. 
            This suggests that a higher rate of poverty in a state is generally associated with a higher 
            percentage of the population who lack access to healthcare, who smoke & who are obese.</p>

          <h4>Age (Median)</h4>
          <p>Using Median Age as the independant variable and lacks healthcare as the dependant variable reveals a weak negative correlation,
            this suggests that states with a higher average age have a higher percentage of healthcare (as a smaller percentage of residents 
            lack healthcare). Changing the dependant variable to percentage of smokers reveals a slightly positive correlation, which suggests 
            that states with higher average age have higher rates of smoking, or that most people who smoke are older. Plotting against rate of
            obesity reveals no significant relationship, suggesting that there is no correlation between age and obesity.</p>

          <h4>Household Income (Median)</h4>
          <p>Using household income as the independant variable shows a weak negative correlation between all three dependant variables.
            This suggests that a higher median income in a state is generally associated with a lower percentage of the population who lack access 
            to healthcare, who smoke & who are obese.</p>
